> This template really just serves as a place to aggregate various bits of useful information you might not know about how to report a bug with Rising Stars (or SR2 itself) in particular; I don't care much about how you present it, but for the more complicated issues, there's a few things that can really help out. Feel free to delete this text once you're done reading!
> 
> ### Logs, logs, gimme all the logs!
> If you haven't already diagnosed your issue, and it isn't trivially reproducible (and sometimes even if it is!), a logfile can be of great use in diagnosing it. Both of these can be found in your game profile folder: `Documents/My Games/Star Ruler 2` on Windows, and [TODO: Remind myself what the path is] on Linux.
> 
> There's only really two types of logfile worth looking at. `log.txt` is the full log for the latest session you played, and is wiped every time you start SR2. If you've closed the game after the bug occurred (or if it crashed), **DO NOT** start it again before you've copied this off to a safe location somehow, or you'll have to reproduce it all over again, first.
> 
> The other logfile is what I colloquially refer to as the "dump log". A timestamped file ending in the extension `.mdmp.txt`, it is usually generated alongside a minidump (.mdmp) file of the same name whenever the game crashes. The minidump itself is useless to me: I have neither the tools nor expertise to really dissect them, even when they're generated by OpenSR instead of a commercial client. But the dump log is one of the best resources I can ask for when debugging a crash, and I'm often completely lost without one.
> 
> ### Clean repro cases are hard to find
> Sometimes, a bug is straightforward enough that merely describing it is enough to figure it out: Outdated descriptions, bad stats on a subsystem, and so on. Sometimes you have to follow a pretty clear set of steps isolated from the rest of the game, like installing a Mining Complex on an Economic Starbase and telling it to capture an asteroid.
> 
> But sometimes you don't know how you found it; you just know it's there, and you know you can repeat it by loading a recent save and repeating whatever you did in the time since the game was saved.  If that happens, the best thing you can do to help is list off *everything* you did (or maybe record a video of it?), and give me the savefile so I can try doing it myself.
> 
> ### Mod lists and versioning
> Some bugs may only occur in a certain revision of Rising Stars, a specific version of SR2, or with a specific combination of other mods. Make sure to specify the revision number (shown in the lower right corner in the main menu), and tell me about any other mods you're using. This is particularly important if you've given me a savefile to investigate, because I can't load it without all the same mods! (Incidentally, the names of the mod folders are also important, if you're using any non-Steam mods.)
