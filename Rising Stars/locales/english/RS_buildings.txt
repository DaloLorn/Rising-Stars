COND_ANCIENT_CANNON: Ancient Planetary Defenses
COND_ANCIENT_CANNON_DESC: <<|
	An ancient defense system of immense power is located on the surface, inactive but usable.
>>
BLD_ANCIENT_CANNON: Ancient Gravitational Collapser
BLD_ANCIENT_CANNON_DESC: <<
	A reactivated ancient weapon of considerable firepower.

	If operational, fires a projectile every 10 seconds, dealing between 500 and 37500 damage to all targets within 50 units of the explosion, depending on their size. Size 100 ships will take 2500 damage per hit, size 20 or smaller will take 500 damage per hit, size 1500 or larger will take 37500 damage per hit.

	If the planet is under siege and has no defenses remaining in orbit, the weapon is deactivated.

	This weapon does not require an orbital control satellite, as its integrated sensor array is perfectly capable of tracking enemy targets on its own.
>>
BLD_VANGUARDPORTAL: Portal Stabilizer
BLD_VANGUARDPORTAL_DESC: <<
	An immensely powerful hyperfield manipulator. When activated and targeted at a specific point in space along with two other Stabilizers, this structure will create a massive wormhole to the Overlord home galaxy, enabling the Overlords' invasion force to enter this galaxy.

	[img=ShieldImpactLarge*#de12de;20]Constructing three Portal Stabilizers will cause you to win a Vanguard Victory.[/img]
	[img=Plus;20]The presence of a Portal Stabilizer inspires the owner's race to fight harder to defend the system, manifesting as a 40% boost to fleet effectiveness to all owned fleets in the system.[/img]
	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Intense rivalry between Vanguard races - and the desire of non-Vanguard races to keep the Overlords away - cause the Stabilizer to self-destruct or be destroyed, respectively, when the planet's owner changes for any reason.[/img]
	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Can only be constructed once per planet, and can only be constructed on a Ringworld or Artificial Planetoid.[/img]

	[img=Plus;20]Generates both Ore and Base Materials. Generates 7.5 Base Materials and 45 Ore per minute.[/img]
	[img=Plus;20]Two Ore Transmuters will generate more of each resource type than a Strip Miner and a Transmuter combined. This effect is slightly dampened by the [bbloc=#R_CORE_OPTIMIZATIONS/] tech.[/img]
	[img=Minus;20]Requires a small maintenance cost, and combines the construction costs of Strip Miners and Transmuters.[/img]

	The grid is composed of $1 missile launchers totaling $2 DPS with $3 range.

	[i]The missiles are guided by a satellite in orbit and will not be launched if the satellite is destroyed. If the satellite is destroyed, a new one will be deployed after a 3-minute period.

	If there are enemy fleets in orbit and you do not have any remaining support ships to protect the planet, the satellite will not be replaced.[/i]

	[b][img=ResourceIconsSmall::81;20/] [color=#cda33d]Base Material Used:[/color][/b][offset=210]$1 / minute[/offset]

	[i][color=#aaa]This building requires a certain amount of Base Materials to be consumed every minute to be active. If there are any Base Materials present on the planet, the building will attempt to consume those before tapping the global pool.[/color][/i]
>>
TIP_BASE_MATERIAL: <<
	[i][color=#aaa]By default, Base Materials are stored in and consumed from the global resource pool. However, exporting this planet's resource to a different planet will store them in that planet's local resource pool instead. If enough Base Materials are exported to that planet, this can ensure that a supply shortage in the global pool will not prevent the planet's buildings from functioning.[/color][/i]
>>
BLD_PLANET_CANNON_DESC: <<
	An enormous railgun on the planet's surface propels large projectiles towards enemy fleets in the system, inflicting devastating damage.

	The cannon deals 2500 Damage every 5 seconds at 2000 range.

	[i]The cannon's targeting telemetry is provided by a satellite in orbit, and the cannon will not fire if the satellite is destroyed. If the satellite is destroyed, a new one will be deployed after a 3-minute period.

	If there are enemy fleets in orbit and you do not have any remaining support ships to protect the planet, the satellite will not be replaced.[/i]
