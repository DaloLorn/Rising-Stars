BLD_VANGUARDPORTAL: Portal Stabilizer
BLD_VANGUARDPORTAL_DESC: <<
	An immensely powerful hyperfield manipulator. When activated and targeted at a specific point in space along with two other Stabilizers, this structure will create a massive wormhole to the Overlord home galaxy, enabling the Overlords' invasion force to enter this galaxy.

	[img=ShieldImpactLarge*#de12de;20]Constructing three Portal Stabilizers will cause you to win a Vanguard Victory.[/img]
	[img=Plus;20]The presence of a Portal Stabilizer inspires the owner's race to fight harder to defend the system, manifesting as a 40% boost to fleet effectiveness to all owned fleets in the system.[/img]
	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Intense rivalry between Vanguard races - and the desire of non-Vanguard races to keep the Overlords away - cause the Stabilizer to self-destruct or be destroyed, respectively, when the planet's owner changes for any reason.[/img]
