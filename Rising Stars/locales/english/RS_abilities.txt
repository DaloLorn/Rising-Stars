ABL_ANCIENT_BUILD_ORE_TRANSMUTER: Attempt to Build Ore Transmuter
ABL_ANCIENT_BUILD_ORE_TRANSMUTER_DESC: Move to the target planet and attempt to build an Ore Transmuter on it. Building will fail if insufficient funds are available.
ABL_SCUTTLEDERELICT: Scuttle Derelict Ship
ABL_SCUTTLEDERELICT_DESC: <<
	Sends a demolition crew to plant charges on the target derelict. The remains of the target ship are destroyed.
>>
ABL_PROGENITOR_COMMANDCODES: Override Remnant Programming
ABL_PROGENITOR_COMMANDCODES_DESC: <<
	Using our command codes, we can access the control computers of Keeper fleets, overriding the ancient directives programmed by our ancestors so that they do our bidding.
	
	Properly reactivating the fleets will require some energy, though, and we do not have the codes for the great Guardians that watch over the Hubworlds.
>>
ABL_RECALL: Recall
ABL_BOARDING_PARTY: Send Boarding Party
ABL_BOARDING_PARTY_DESC: <<
	Transports a boarding party to the target object, initiating a boarding action.

	Boarding parties periodically damage the target, gradually losing troops depending on the target's boarding defense. If the target sustains critical damage and does not have a functioning Self-Destruct Device, it will become neutral for a period dependent on how many troops survived the boarding action, then transfer control to your empire. While it is neutral, the surviving troops will repair the ship for a total of 60 HP per soldier.

	Only one boarding action can be running on an object at any given time, and Verdant-owned objects cannot be boarded. Boarding actions cannot be initiated by ships which are already being boarded. Orbitals always have a boarding defense of 100.
>>
ABL_RECALL_DESC: Opens a wormhole engulfing the target allied object and immediately depositing it in close proximity to the recalling object.
ABL_PROTO_LEVEL3: Form Planet (Tier 3)
ABL_PROTO_LEVEL3_DESC: Manipulate the planet's formation by expending a large amount of energy. The planet will produce a random tier 3 resource.

ABL_ADD_FLOATING_CONTINENT: Claim Floating Continent
ABL_ADD_FLOATING_CONTINENT_DESC: <<
	Claim the floating continent and attach it to one of your planets to build on.

	For a cost of energy dependent on distance, the floating continent and all buildings on it can be moved to another one of your planets.

	Floating continents impede the construction of subsurface habitats and cannot be placed on planets while such construction is taking place.
>>
ABL_TRANSFER_FLOATING_CONTINENT: Move Floating Continent
ABL_TRANSFER_FLOATING_CONTINENT_DESC: <<
	Move the floating continent and all buildings on it from this planet to another one of your planets.

	The energy cost to move the floating continent is dependent on the distance between the two planets.

	This ability cannot be activated while the planet the floating continent is currently on is under siege.

	Floating continents impede the construction of subsurface habitats and cannot be placed on planets while such construction is taking place.
>>
ABL_OVERCHARGE_FLEET_DESC: <<
	Increase the targeted fleet's effectiveness by 40%.

	A fleet can only be upgraded once.
>>
ABL_OVERCHARGE_FLEET: Perform Ancient Retrofit
ABL_RAMMING_SPEED: Ramming Speed
ABL_RAMMING_SPEED_DESC: <<
	Diverts all power to the ship's engines in an attempt to deliver its payload.

	Adds 10 u/s^2 of acceleration. Lasts 25 seconds.
>>
ABL_GUARDIAN_ACTIVATE: Activate Guardian Facility
ABL_GUARDIAN_ACTIVATE_DESC: <<
	Reactivate the shipyard, reaping many benefits but undoubtedly incurring the wrath of all but your most loyal allies and the blindest of fools.

	While active, the Guardian Facility's immense and ancient matter fabrication facilities can construct anything as if it were a planet, store up to 5000 Labor, generate 100 Labor per minute, produce 15 Research per second, and import Labor from other planets without any penalties. Alternatively, it can begin construction of a new Guardian.

	Unfortunately, while the facility does contain the blueprints required to construct a Guardian, they, just like any unfinished parts of the ship, are inaccessible. Learning how it works will have to be done when and if such a ship is completed.

	Upon sustaining critical damage for any reason, the Guardian Facility will revert to its deactivated state.

	[b][color=#f00]WARNING: Other empires will be immediately notified of the facility's reactivation, and are likely to launch an assault![/color][/b]
>>
ABL_GUARDIAN_BUILD: Commence Guardian Construction
ABL_GUARDIAN_BUILD_DESC: <<
	Uses the ancient blueprints stored in the facility's databanks to construct the components for a powerful Remnant Guardian. This construction project will take a substantial amount of time and resources, and we will not be able to use the facility for any other purpose.

	Building a Guardian takes a minimum of 15 minutes, during which the Guardian Facility will no longer be able to use or store Labor, stop generating Research, and consume 10 Energy per second, 2.5 FTL per second, and incur a maintenance of ยง2M per budget cycle.

	Once ready, the Guardian's construction will require a bulk payment of 2000 Energy, 1000 FTL and ยง5M to finalize.

	[b][color=#f00]WARNING: Losing the Guardian Facility for any reason while construction is in progress will cancel the project without refunding any spent resources! Aside from this, there is no way of canceling construction of a Guardian, so be absolutely certain you want to do it!

	Additionally, other empires will be immediately notified when construction begins, and are likely to launch an assault![/color][/b]
>>
ABL_GUARDIAN_FINISH: Finalize Guardian Construction
ABL_GUARDIAN_FINISH_DESC: <<
	Assembles a Guardian from previously constructed modules. At this stage, if the galaxy has not already surrendered to you, it probably will; only the mythical 'Revenant' could reliably take on the combined forces of a Guardian and the rest of your empire.

	Furthermore, analysis of the completed ship will yield insights into its advanced technology, allowing us to design our own ships based on the Guardian's equipment.

	Other empires will be notified of the project's completion, and the Guardian Facility will resume normal operation.
>>
ABL_SELF_DESTRUCT: Initiate Self-Destruct
ABL_SELF_DESTRUCT_DESC: Activate the self-destruct device contained on this ship, detonating the ship in a fiery inferno.

ABL_PREPARE_HARVEST: Prepare Planet for Harvesting
ABL_PREPARE_HARVEST_DESC: <<
	Tags any and all valuable resources on the planet surface for collection by a Ringworld. The process is a lengthy one; the beam must remain active for 6 consecutive minutes.

	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Cannot target Barren planets, Ringworlds or Artificial Planetoids.[/img]
>>
ABL_STEAL_RESOURCES: Harvest Planet
ABL_STEAL_RESOURCES_DESC: <<
	Simultaneously transfers all valuable resources from a target planet and onto the Ringworld. The planet is left a barren wasteland and can then be consumed by a Harvester.

	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Planets must be marked by a Harvester using the 'Prepare Planet for Harvesting' ability.[/img]
	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Vast Plains and resources generated by the presence of Altars, Megafarms and Hydrogenators will not be affected, though other resources on those planets will.[/img]
>>
ABL_MINE_PLANET: Devour Planet
ABL_MINE_PLANET_DESC: <<
	A series of tractor beams and mining lasers harvest minerals from a barren planet until the planet is destroyed.

	Rapidly produces Ore. Can only target Barren planets. 2.5k Ore is generated for every 1G of damage to the planet.
>>
ABL_MECHANOID_COLONIZE: Transfer $1B Population
ABL_MECHANOID_COLONIZE_DESC: Transfer $1B Population from this planet to another. Transfering population costs FTL energy, but can be done freely to colonize new planets or supply existing colonies with more population.
ABL_BIND_ASTEROID: Begin Mining Operation
ABL_BIND_ASTEROID_DESC: <<
	Capture an asteroid with the orbital's tractor beams and establish a mining base to extract valuable materials. The materials will then be sent by freighter to a friendly planet.

	The mining base will not interfere with the activities of any starships assigned to mine the asteroid, but only one base can be established per asteroid.

	When the main deposit is depleted, the base will continue harvesting resources at a reduced rate, but regular miners will no longer be effective.
>>
ABL_MATERIALS_ON: Resume Global Consumption (Base Materials)
ABL_MATERIALS_ON_DESC: Allows all buildings on the planet to resume consumption of Base Materials from the global pool.
ABL_MATERIALS_OFF: Disable Global Consumption (Base Materials)
ABL_MATERIALS_OFF_DESC: <<
	Prevents all buildings on the planet from consuming Base Materials from the global pool.

	Buildings requiring Base Materials will still attempt to consume them from the local pool, but if none are present, they will be deactivated until the ban is lifted or additional Base Materials are imported.
>>
ABL_ORE_ON: Resume Ore Consumption
ABL_ORE_ON_DESC: Allows all buildings on the planet to resume Ore consumption.
ABL_ORE_OFF: Disable Ore Consumption
ABL_ORE_OFF_DESC: <<
	Prevents all buildings on the planet from consuming Ore.

	Buildings requiring Ore will be deactivated until the ban is lifted.
>>
ABL_PREPARE_HARVEST_FAST_DESC: <<
	Tags any and all valuable resources on the planet surface for collection by a Ringworld. The process is a lengthy one; the beam must remain active for 4 consecutive minutes.

	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Cannot target Barren planets, Ringworlds or Artificial Planetoids.[/img]
>>
ABL_GATE_UNPACK: Unpack Gate
ABL_GATE_UNPACK_DESC: <<
	Unpack the gate at the targeted location. The gate will move there using its maneuvering thrusters, then unpack and reactivate itself. Activating a gate has a single-time FTL cost.

	Active gates cannot be tractored.
>>
ABL_FTL_JAMMER: FTL Jammer Overcharge
ABL_FTL_JAMMER_DESC: Prevents all hostile FTL in this system for 3 minutes. Costs 200 FTL.
ABL_GRAVITON_CONDENSER_DESC: <<
	Fire a beam that collapses a celestial object's own gravity into itself, leading it to compress and eventually detonate.

	The beam must be channelled for 30 seconds before it starts dealing damage.
>>
ABL_FLARE_BOMB_DESC: <<
	After a 60 second channel period, trigger the star to emit a critical flare, wiping out all population in the solar system but leaving everything else intact. The planets in the system are irradiated for the next 5 minutes and cannot be colonized.

	The star takes considerable damage during the last 30 seconds of channelling. The flare bomb ship is destroyed in the process.
>>
ABL_GATE_SEQUENCE: Gate Sequencing
ABL_GATE_SEQUENCE_DESC: <<
	Use an excessive amount of FTL energy to brute-force through enemy FTL suppression and jamming, keeping the gate operational in any environment.

	Sequenced gates require considerably more FTL energy to operate.
>>
ABL_SHADOWPORT_UNPACK: Unpack Shadowport
ABL_SHADOWPORT_UNPACK_DESC: <<
	Unpack the shadowport at the designated location. The shadowport will use its sublight drive to travel to the destination before diverting engine power to resource processing facilities.

	Unpacked shadowports cannot move or be tractored, but can receive resources from planets corrupted by their owner, and generate a limited amount of income and Labor.

	NOTE: Shadowports can only receive resources from corrupted planets they can trade to. Shadowports in interstellar space are therefore unable to receive resources from any planets.
>>
ABL_SHADOWPORT_PACK: Pack Up Shadowport
ABL_SHADOWPORT_PACK_DESC: <<
	Deactivate the shadowport's resource processors and redirect power to its propulsion systems.

	Packed shadowports cannot receive resources from corrupted planets and lose their innate income and Labor (Construction Bays/Ore Processors are not affected), but can use their engines to move around the galaxy.
>>
ABL_RACKETEERING: Begin Racketeering
ABL_RACKETEERING_DESC: <<
	Take advantage of our influence over a planet's government and infrastructure to set up a racketeering operation, redirecting part of its industrial output to the Shadowport.

	Steals 20% of the targeted corrupted planet's civilian resource production and grants it to the Shadowport. Resources produced by imperial buildings or miscellaneous effects are not affected. Only one Shadowport may manage a racketeering operation on a given planet; any existing operations on the planet will be transferred to this Shadowport.

	NOTE: Although they can manage racketeering operations on any planet, shadowports can only receive racketeering income from planets they have trade access to.
