TRAIT_FLUX_DESC: <<
	Your empire maintains an intricate flux field across all its systems to allow for instantaneous spatial translation.

	Your ships instantly FTL to any system you have vision over. A fleet that has recently used the flux field cannot use it again immediately. Your ships are unable to travel through deep space.

	Ships cost FTL Energy to build.

	You automatically gain vision over all systems within your trade range. You start the game with a free Subspace Telescope Array, and cannot research other FTL methods.
