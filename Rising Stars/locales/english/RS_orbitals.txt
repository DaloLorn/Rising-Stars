ORB_GUARDIAN: Guardian Facility
ORB_GUARDIAN_BLURB: Acts as a Research-generating super-shipyard, or constructs a powerful Guardian.
ORB_GUARDIAN_DESC: <<
	An ancient shipyard of tremendous scale used to construct Guardians, the so-called 'Guardian Facility' is as valuable as the knowledge on the nearby Hubworld.

	The advanced nature of the facility's matter fabricators and the phase shifting it uses to store finished components produce an immense quantity of Research. The technology itself allows the facility to construct anything as if it were a planet, import Labor from other planets, generate 100 Labor per minute and store 5000 Labor. It cannot, however, be used to export Labor to other shipyards.

	The sheer size of the facility makes it impossible to move through conventional means, while its phasing technology causes complications when attempting to use FTL systems to propel it. Additionally, automated security systems of considerable complexity prevent boarding parties from making any progress while attacking it.

	If damaged severely enough, the Guardian Facility will shut down and phase-shift; while its location is no longer a mystery, it will have to be reactivated and repaired again.

ORB_ANCIENT_REPLICATOR_DESC: <<
	A vast low-orbit station that can replicate materials and transfer them to the surface. Control Hubs can only be constructed on planets with a Replicator in orbit. Other buildings may also be constructed by a Fabricator.

	Replicator stations can be moved between planets in order to construct facilities on other planets.

	If the planet the replicator is in orbit of has free support capacity, it will automatically construct defense satellites for it over time. Additionally, the planet receives a +100% boost to fleet effectiveness while the replicator is in orbit.

ORB_MONO_COLONY: Transit Hub
ORB_MONO_COLONY_BLURB: Reduces population transfer costs to 25 FTL between systems containing Transit Hubs. Global trade node.
ORB_MONO_COLONY_DESC: <<
	A suite of sensors and hyperfield manipulators used to streamline the transfer of goods and personnel between star systems. Organic life cannot survive unprotected hyperspace transit, though, so it can only be fully utilized by synthetic beings.

	Sets Mechanoid population transfer costs to 25 FTL/unit between any two systems containing Transit Hubs.

	Also allows unrestricted trade between any two systems containing Transit Hubs, Commerce Hubs, Gates, or other global trade nodes.

	Costs 0.05 FTL to maintain.
>>
ORB_BEACON_DESC: <<
	A giant beacon that periodically guides refugee ships to this galaxy to settle on nearby planets.

	Resources can be traded freely between territories with Beacons and Signposts in them.

	If using jumpdrives, fleets can jump to this system from any distance without risk of damage.

	When importing resources with Energy, Defense, or Research pressure, the empire will slowly gain stores of Support which can be spent on various benefits and projects at any Beacon.

	Importing resources with Labor pressure will convert the pressure into Labor generation for all Beacons and Signposts in the empire.

	Beacons receive only 66% Labor generation from any source.
>>
ORB_BEACON_MINI: Signpost
ORB_BEACON_MINI_BLURB: Cheap miniature Beacon mostly useful to build new Beacons.
ORB_BEACON_MINI_DESC: <<
	A scaled-down Beacon that can be used to guide other Beacons to this galaxy.

	Resources can be traded freely between territories with Beacons and Signposts in them.

	If using jumpdrives, fleets can jump to this system from any distance without risk of damage.

	When importing resources with Energy, Defense, or Research pressure, the empire will slowly gain stores of Support which can be spent on various benefits and projects at any Beacon.

	Importing resources with Labor pressure will convert the pressure into Labor generation for all Beacons and Signposts in the empire.

	Signposts receive only 33% Labor generation from any source, receive reduced benefits from Beacon upgrades, and can only use Labor to guide new Beacons into the galaxy.
