OUTPOST_ARMORING: Structural Enhancement
OUTPOST_ARMORING_DESC: <<
	Reinforce the orbital's frame and outer hull, allowing it to withstand more damage before critical failure.

	Adds 10000 health and 5000 armor. May be modified by upgrades that improve orbital health. Subsequent structural enhancement requires increasingly large amounts of Ore to perform.
>>
OUTPOST_DEFENSE: Refit Launch Bays
OUTPOST_DEFENSE_DESC: <<
	Perform a substantial retrofit of the orbital's hangar deck and docking ports, allowing it to support more vessels coming in or out at any given time. The additional traffic also encourages the civilian sector to assist with constructing additional defense ships.
