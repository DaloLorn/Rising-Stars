CONS_MOON_BASE_DESC: <<
	Construct a large amount of infrastructure on one of the planet's moons, making more area available for placing buildings and increasing the maximum population of the planet by 2.

	Only one moon base may be constructed for every moon present in orbit of the planet.

	Mechanoid races receive §100k additional income from each moon base they own.
>>
C_TERRAFORMING_DESC: <<
	[color=#aaa][i]Modifying the climate or constructing the required support infrastructure to easily sustain large amounts of people or equipment within a certain area is usually a slow venture.
	
	An industrial-scale project sponsored by the empire can accelerate the process considerably, for a price.[/i][/color]
	
	Develops up to 15 randomly selected tiles.
>>
C_HABITATRING_DESC: <<
	[color=#aaa][i]Constructing a large ring-shaped station encircling the planet provides more space for the construction of important infrastructure.[/i][/color]
	
	Adds a 4x8 chunk of fully-developed Artificial tiles to the planet. Can only be built once per planet.

C_SUBSURFACE_HABITATS: Subsurface Habitation Complex
C_SUBSURFACE_NO_FLOATING_CONTINENT: [i]Subsurface habitats cannot be built while a Floating Continent is present on the planet surface. Move the Floating Continent to a different planet before attempting to construct them.[/i]
C_SUBSURFACE_HABITATS_DESC: <<
	[color=#aaa][i]Constructing an underground complex kilometers underneath the planet's surface provides more space for the construction of important infrastructure.[/i][/color]

	Adds a 10x2 chunk of undeveloped Artificial tiles to the planet. Can only be built once per planet. Unlocks the 'Expand Subsurface Complex' construction.

C_EXPAND_SUBSURFACE: Expand Subsurface Complex
C_EXPAND_SUBSURFACE_DESC: <<
	[color=#aaa][i]Expanding our subsurface habitats grants us even more space for the construction of important infrastructure.[/i][/color]

	Adds a 10x1 chunk of undeveloped Artificial tiles to the planet, attached to the Subsurface Habitation Complex. Subsequent subsurface habitat expansions will require increasingly large amounts of Ore and Labor to construct.

OUTPOST_ARMORING: Structural Enhancement
OUTPOST_ARMORING_DESC: <<
	Reinforce the orbital's frame and outer hull, allowing it to withstand more damage before critical failure.

	Adds 10000 health and 5000 armor. May be modified by upgrades that improve orbital health. Subsequent structural enhancement requires increasingly large amounts of Ore to perform.
>>
OUTPOST_DEFENSE: Refit Launch Bays
OUTPOST_DEFENSE_DESC: <<
	Perform a substantial retrofit of the orbital's hangar deck and docking ports, allowing it to support more vessels coming in or out at any given time. The additional traffic also encourages the civilian sector to assist with constructing additional defense ships.

	Adds 256 support capacity and 4 Defense generation. Subsequent hangar refits require increasingly large amounts of Ore to perform.
>>
OUTPOST_WEAPONS: Install Swarm Missiles
OUTPOST_WEAPONS_DESC: <<
