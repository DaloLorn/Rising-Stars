OPT_MTE: Use Multiple Themes
OPTTT_MTE: <<
	When toggled on, the game will randomly select a valid .ogg file in data/music/theme to play while in the main menu. If no valid files are found, this option will automatically be switched off.
>>
OPT_THEME_LOOP: Loop Main Menu Theme
OPTTT_THEME_LOOP: <<
	When toggled on, the game will repeat the theme song as long as you're not in a match. If used alongside 'Use Multiple Themes', this will randomly cycle through all the files in data/music/theme.
>>
OPT_DISPLAY_SENSOR_RANGE: Display Sensor Range
OPTTT_DISPLAY_SENSOR_RANGE: <<
	When toggled on, selecting an object owned by your empire will always display its sensor range as a dim blue circle. Seeable range (if applicable) is displayed as a dim pinkish circle.

NIGHTMARE: Nightmare

NEBULA_FREQ: Spatial Anomaly Occurrence
NGTT_ANOMALY_SYSTEM_OCCURANCE: <<
	The frequency at which anomalous systems (nebulae, empty space) occur in this galaxy.

	[b]WARNING: Setting this to maximum will cause all non-homeworld, non-unique systems (Orathi, galactic black hole) to be spatial anomalies. This will drastically affect gameplay within the galaxy, and is not recommended![/b]
>>

NG_BLACK_HOLE_OCCURANCE: Black Hole Occurrence
NGTT_BLACK_HOLE_OCCURANCE: <<
	Multiplier to the base frequency at which black hole systems occur in the universe. Does not affect the black holes spawned at the center of large galaxies.
>>

NG_SENSOR_OPTIONS: Sensor Options
NG_SENSOR_MULT: Global Sensor Multiplier
NGTT_SENSOR_MULT: The number by which all sight ranges in the game are multiplied. This is applied after all other sensor modifiers; useful when modifying the System Size option among other things.

NG_FTL_MULT: FTL Storage/Generation Multiplier
NGTT_FTL_MULT: <<
	The number by which the storage capacity and generation rate of FTL Energy on a starship are multiplied. Increases the amount of FTL Energy generated from one FTL Crystal.

	Useful when modifying galaxy spacing. For every 130000 units of spacing added, it is recommended that you increase this number by approximately 1.0. (Developer note: For example, 130000 spacing is 1.0, 260000 spacing is 2.0... you get the point.)
>>

NG_LEGACY_EXPLORATION: Legacy Exploration Mode
NGTT_LEGACY_EXPLORATION: <<
	When checked, entering a non-nebula system will immediately reveal everything inside, as if it were an unmodified game of Star Ruler 2.
	
	Sight range modifiers of all kinds will still take effect, though, making sensors useful when flying inside nebulae, flying a cloaked ship, or when searching for objects in interstellar space.
>>

NG_ADVANCED_OPTIONS: Advanced Options
NG_ADVANCED_OPTIONS_DESC: <<
	This tab contains options that, while (probably) safe to use, are not expected to be frequently used by players, and may sometimes cause balance issues or make some aspects of the game more difficult to use if they are misused.

	[i][b]Multiplayer hosts: It is recommended that these options not be used without the knowledge and consent of the people you are playing with.[/b][/i]
>>

NG_PLANET_MOON_CHANCE: Moon Occurrence
NGTT_PLANET_MOON_CHANCE: The probability that a planet will have a moon. (Developer note: I suspect that the game will add moons to a planet until the random number generator fails to produce an acceptable number. Therefore, to prevent instances of locking up the game by telling it to spawn moons ad infinitum, this is capped at 50%. Also, odds are you'll change the amount of moons significantly even by slightly modifying this number.)

NG_PLANET_CONDITION_CHANCE: Condition Occurrence
NGTT_PLANET_CONDITION_CHANCE: The probability that a planet will have a planetary condition. Planetary conditions can have various effects on a planet and its behavior, ranging from a reduced population cap to powerful ancient weapons.

NG_HIDE_EMPIRE_RELATIONS: Hide Empire Relations
NGTT_HIDE_EMPIRE_RELATIONS: When checked, the game will hide relationships between empires from other empires. (Developer note: I think this is supposed to conceal treaties, but I'm not sure just what it DOES do.)

NG_TEAMS_START_CLOSE: Teams Start Together
NGTT_TEAMS_START_CLOSE: When checked, the game will try to place members of a team close to each other, as opposed to evenly distributing everyone across the galaxy.

NG_FIRST_CONTACT: First Contact Mode
NGTT_FIRST_CONTACT: When unchecked, the game will act as if all the empires had already met before the beginning of the match.

NG_NEW_MOVEMENT: New Movement Physics
NGTT_NEW_MOVEMENT: <<
	When checked, the game will use the spacetime drag mechanic from Darloth's "New Movement Physics" mod, as well as the graviton engine buffs from the associated "NMP Graviton Adjust" mod.

	[i][color=#aaa]NMP's lateral thrust functionality is enabled regardless of this setting.[/color][/i]
>>

NG_CARD_STACK_INTERVAL: Influence Stack Refresh Rate
NGTT_CARD_STACK_INTERVAL: How long it takes for the influence card stack to refresh. (Developer note: The timer above the right end of the stack - the thing that controls when new cards are added to/removed from the stack.)

NG_ENERGY_EFFICIENCY_STEP: Energy Efficiency Step
NGTT_ENERGY_EFFICIENCY_STEP: The amount of stored energy that will reduce an empire's energy generation rate by 50%. (Developer note: If you set this to 500, and collect 500 energy, plus your free storage cap, your empire's generation will be halved. If you collect 1000 energy - plus free storage cap - the already halved generation rate will be halved again, for a net energy generation reduction of 75%.)

NG_ENERGY_PER_SEEDSHIP: Energy per Seed Ship
NGTT_ENERGY_PER_SEEDSHIP: How much energy must be collected in the entire galaxy to spawn a new seed ship.

NG_SIEGE_LOYALTY_TIME: Siege Time

NG_RANDOM_EVENT_INTERVAL: Random Event Interval
NGTT_RANDOM_EVENT_INTERVAL: The minimum acceptable interval between the occurance of two random events. After an event has occurred, no new random events can happen until this interval passes.

NG_FIRST_CONTACT_PRIZE: First Contact Bonus
NGTT_FIRST_CONTACT_PRIZE: How many influence points are earnt when an empire is the first one to encounter another empire. Does not apply if First Contact Mode is unchecked.

NG_LABOR_DUMP_TIME: Labor Storage Dump Time
NGTT_LABOR_DUMP_TIME: How long it takes to empty an object's Labor storage into a project. Measured in seconds.

NG_LEVEL_DECAY_TIME: Base Level Decay Time
NGTT_LEVEL_DECAY_TIME: How long it takes for a planet's level to decay if a vital resource is no longer available. Measured in seconds, and can be modified by empire- or planet-specific factors such as technological upgrades.

NG_DRYDOCK_BUILDCOST_FACTOR: Drydock Cost Multiplier
NGTT_DRYDOCK_BUILDCOST_FACTOR: When building from a drydock, this is how much of the ship's original build cost will have to be paid. Negated by the Decentralized Construction tech node.

NG_CRAZY_OPTIONS: Crazy Options
NG_CRAZY_OPTIONS_DESC: <<
	This tab contains options whose functionality is either approaching extreme (and possibly hazardous!) levels of control over the game's mechanics, or is just ludicrous. (Like asteroid mass. :P)

	[i][b][color=#f00]Use these options at your own peril.

	Multiplayer hosts, it is highly recommended that these options are left untouched without the express permission of everyone participating, and prior testing in a singleplayer match.[/color][/b][/i]
>>

NG_ASTEROID_PERMANENT_FREQ: Asteroid Permanent Resource Frequency
NGTT_ASTEROID_PERMANENT_FREQ: The base frequency of permanent (non-consumable) resources on resource asteroids. (Developer note: I think. No idea how it works or if it even does what it says.)

NG_ARTIFACTS_SEEDSHIP_DEATH: Artifacts From Seed Ship Death
NGTT_ARTIFACTS_SEEDSHIP_DEATH: How many artifacts are spawned when a seed ship is destroyed.

NG_ASTEROID_COST_STEP: Asteroid Cost Step
NGTT_ASTEROID_COST_STEP: When building mining bases on asteroids from another star system, determines how much the Labor cost of construction is increased for every star system between the building planet and the asteroid. (Developer note: The shortest trade route is used, with each trade link increasing the cost by the percentage selected here.)

NG_TERRAFORM_COST_STEP: Terraforming Cost Step
NGTT_TERRAFORM_COST_STEP: When terraforming planets from another star system, determines how much the Labor cost of terraforming is increased for every star system between the terraforming planet and the terraformed planet. (Developer note: The shortest trade route is used, with each trade link increasing the cost by the percentage selected here.)

NG_ORBITAL_LABOR_COST_STEP: Orbital Labor Cost Step
NGTT_ORBITAL_LABOR_COST_STEP: When building orbitals from another star system, determines how much the Labor cost of construction is increased for every star system between the building planet and the desired location of the orbital. (Developer note: The shortest trade route is used, with each trade link increasing the cost by the percentage selected here.)

NG_RESEARCH_DECAY_MULT: Research Efficiency Decay
NGTT_RESEARCH_DECAY_MULT: <<
	Affects how many research points must be generated to lower the research generation rate to a certain percentage of the empire's base generation. When set to 100%, an empire must generate 2000 research points to halve its research efficiency.

OPT_RINGWORLD_FIX: Safe Ringworlds
OPTTT_RINGWORLD_FIX: <<
	Disables a part of the Ringworld shader, preventing crashes with certain older graphics cards when using a shader quality level of Medium or higher.

	Due to the resulting loss of quality, it may be advisable not to enable this option if you are not experiencing issues with Ringworld-related crashes.
>>

PRECIOUS_CLOUDS_DESC: <<
	Resources are scarce within this sector of the galaxy; those who can reach and hold the rich nebula at its heart may take them all, but the Remnants do not part with these riches willingly...

	Designed for up to four players. Recommended configurations: 2v2, 1v1, 1v1v1v1
>>

NGTT_ENABLE_TERRAFORMING: <<
