TT_SHIP_STRENGTH: <<
	[font=Medium]Fleet Combat Strength[/font]
	An estimate indicator of the fleet's overall combat strength. Fleets with more strength are more likely to win. Fleet efficiency increases overall DPS and strength.

TT_SHIP_SHIELD: <<
	[font=Medium]Shield[/font]
	Any incoming damage is first blocked by shields. Shield Hardness reduces most incoming damage up to a percentage. Shield Mitigation further reduces the amount of damage taken by shields and reduces the amount of piercing weapon damage penetrating the shield.

TT_INSTANTHYPERDRIVE: <<|
	[b]Sequenced Hyperdrive[/b]

	Use the equipped hyperdrive to immediately engage FTL movement. Costs a lot more FTL energy than a regular jump.
>>

TT_INSTANTFLING: <<|
	[b]Sequenced Fling[/b]

	Use the nearby fling beacon to immediately engage FTL movement. Costs a lot more FTL energy than a regular jump.
>>

TT_INSTANTSLIPSTREAM: <<|
	[b]Generate Sequenced Slipstream Tear[/b]

	Use the ship's slipstream generator to immediately create a new tear to the target destination. Costs a lot more FTL energy than a regular slipstream tear, and suffers significant penalties to tear lifetime and accuracy.
>>

TT_INSTANTJUMPDRIVE: <<|
	[b]Sequenced Jumpdrive[/b]

	Use the equipped jumpdrive to immediately engage FTL movement. Costs a lot more FTL energy than a regular jump, and suffers significant penalties to safe jump range.
>>

TT_INSTANTFLUX_ENABLE: <<|
	[b]Enable Flux Sequencing[/b]

	Spend a substantial amount of FTL energy to make flux jumps without a recharge period. This can be done even while the flux drive is already recharging, and will instantly recharge the drive when jumping. The FTL cost of each jump is proportional to the cooldown that would normally be incurred by that jump, as well as any leftover cooldown time from previous jumps.
>>
TT_INSTANTFLUX_DISABLE: <<|
	[b]Disable Flux Sequencing[/b]

	Stop spending FTL energy on flux jumps, at the cost of once again incurring a cooldown period after each jump.

TT_COLONIZE_FLUX: <<|
	[b]Colonize via Flux[/b]

	Send 1B population from the planet to another unoccupied planet to colonize it.

	If the target planet is not in the same system, flux jumps made during colonization will incur a total cost of 25 FTL.
>>
TT_COLONIZE_THIS_FLUX: <<|
	[b]Colonize This via Flux[/b]

	Send 1B population from one of your planets to this planet to colonize it.

	If the origin planet is not in the same system, flux jumps made during colonization will incur a total cost of 25 FTL.
>>
TT_COLONIZE_FTL: <<|
	[b]Colonize via $1[/b]

	Send 1B population from the planet to another unoccupied planet to colonize it, allowing them to use $1 FTL systems for interstellar travel.

	If the target planet is not in the same system, FTL use during colonization will incur a total cost of $2 FTL.
>>
TT_COLONIZE_THIS_FTL: <<|
	[b]Colonize This via $1[/b]

	Send 1B population from one of your planets to this planet to colonize it, allowing them to use $1 FTL systems for interstellar travel.

	If the origin planet is not in the same system, FTL use during colonization will incur a total cost of $2 FTL.
