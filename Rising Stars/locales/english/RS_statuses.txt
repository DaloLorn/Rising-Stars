>>
STATUS_STEALTHED: Stealthed
STATUS_GATE_SEQUENCED: Sequenced Gate
STATUS_GATE_SEQUENCED_DESC: This gate is being kept online via hyperfield sequencing. It consumes considerably higher amounts of FTL energy, but cannot be jammed or suppressed in any way.
STATUS_CORRUPTED: Corrupted
STATUS_CORRUPTED_DESC: <<
	This planet's government and infrastructure have been suborned using the data-gathering and manipulation capabilities of our Hacker Arrays.

	Although the planet remains nominally under the control of its empire, it will now inform us of any movements within the system and act as a safe haven for our smugglers, providing vision and trade access as if it were one of our colonies.

	Additionally, any one of our Shadowports with trade access to this system can now siphon off a portion of the planet's civilian resource production.
>>
STATUS_SHADOWPORT_STEALING: Racketeering
STATUS_SHADOWPORT_STEALING_DESC: <<
	Using loopholes, bribery, and extortion, our agents on the planet have begun redirecting some of this planet's economic output to a nearby Shadowport.
