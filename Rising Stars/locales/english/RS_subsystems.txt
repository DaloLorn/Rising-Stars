// ****************SUBSYSTEM STATS HERE!********************
// *********************************************************

S_COMBATSUPPLYREGEN: Combat Supply Regeneration
STT_COMBATSUPPLYREGEN: <<
	The rate at which this ship regenerates Supply in combat. This is in addition to normal Supply regeneration.
>>
S_BOARDTOTAL: Boarding Defense
STT_BOARDTOTAL: <<
	The strength with which the ship will fight off boarders. This number must exceed the Boarding Strength of the attacking ship's Boarding Parties in order to survive a boarding action.
>>
S_BOARDSUBSYS: Boarding Strength
STT_BOARDSUBSYS: <<
	The strength this subsystem contributes to a boarding defense. Only Boarding Parties contribute to an offensive boarding action; their offensive strength is the same as their defensive strength.
>>
S_SENSORRANGE: Base Sensor Range
STT_SENSORRANGE: <<
	How far the ship can see, prior to the application of any multiplying effects such as entering a nebula, and prior to modification by the game's Global Sensor Multiplier.
	
	This does not necessarily have to be the actual range of the ship's sensors, but it might provide a good idea of how big that range will be.
>>
S_STRENGTH: Base Combat Strength
STT_STRENGTH: <<
	How well the ship should perform in combat. This is based both on its predicted survivability (design flaws such as exposed bridges notwithstanding) and the amount of damage it deals. (The ship's 'Base Toughness' and 'Damage / Second' statistics, respectively, represent these values.)

	This is not necessarily an accurate value - other factors such as battle damage, lack of supply, or flagship naming can alter a ship's Combat Strength - however it can still be a useful baseline.
>>
S_HULLSTRENGTH: Base Toughness
STT_HULLSTRENGTH: <<
	How well the ship should withstand hostile attacks. This is based on a variety of factors such as repair rate, shield strength and hull strength - regardless, major design flaws such as exposed control cores may cause this value to be drastically higher than it realistically should be.

	This is not necessarily an accurate value - various effects that alter the ship's maximum health can change its Toughness. 
>>
S_PLANETMININGRATE: Mining Rate
STT_PLANETMININGRATE: The rate at which this ship can mine materials from planets and put them into cargo storage.
S_REPAIR: Repair Rate
STT_REPAIR: The amount of hitpoints the ship can repair per second while out of combat.
S_REPAIR_COMBAT: In-Combat Repair Rate
STT_REPAIR_COMBAT: The amount of hitpoints the ship can repair per second while in combat.
S_REGENPERSECOND: Regeneration Rate

S_DEFENSEGENERATION: Defense Generation
S_FORCEFIELD_STAT: Forcefield Capacity
S_FORCEFIELDREGEN: Forcefield Regeneration
S_DAMAGEFACTOR: Damage Multiplier
S_REPAIRFACTOR: Repair Multiplier
S_MITIGATION: Maximum Shield Mitigation
S_SHARED_HP: Shared Health
STT_MITIGATION: <<
	A measure of how much damage is ignored by the ship's shields at maximum mitigation. Mitigation starts at a minimum threshold, increasing as incoming damage is absorbed and decaying over time.
	
	 Piercing weapons such as Railguns or Muon Cannons behave as 'negative mitigation' for the purposes of shield mitigation, with any leftover penetration being turned into bleedthrough damage. Bleedthrough is particularly likely in the first moments of combat, while mitigation is still low.

	Penetrating weapons such as Piercing Drones have an extreme amount of shield penetration for their piercing value, and are likely to ignore most shields altogether.
>>
S_SHIELDABSORB: Maximum Shield Absorption
STT_SHIELDABSORB: <<
	How much damage the ship's shields can take without depleting at maximum mitigation. Shield penetration aside, it is also the amount of damage required to (eventually) start dealing damage to the ship's hull.
>>
S_MINIMUMMITIGATION: Minimum Shield Mitigation
STT_MINIMUMMITIGATION: <<
	The minimum value the ship's shield mitigation can decay to. Destroying shield generator or hardener hexes will reduce minimum mitigation until they are repaired.
>>
S_MINSHIELDABSORB: Minimum Shield Absorption
STT_MINSHIELDABSORB: <<
	How much damage the ship's shields can take without depleting at minimum mitigation. This is generally not very important, as most weapons will fire quickly enough to overcome mitigation decay.
>>
S_MITIGATIONGROWTH: Mitigation Growth Rate
STT_MITIGATIONGROWTH: <<
	How much damage (relative to shield capacity) needs to be absorbed by or bleed through the ship's shields to increase shield mitigation by 1%. Lowering this value (or lowering shield capacity) will increase the speed at which shield mitigation reaches its maximum.

	Damage from Shock Missiles, Disruptors, Particle Lances, Warheads, or Shield Harmonizers does not increase shield mitigation. Destroying shield generator or hardener hexes will reduce mitigation growth until they are repaired.
>>
S_MITIGATIONDECAY: Mitigation Decay Rate
STT_MITIGATIONDECAY: <<
	How much shield mitigation decays per second. Destroying shield generator hexes will increase mitigation decay until they are repaired.
>>
S_SHIELDHARDENING: Shield Hardness
STT_SHIElDHARDENING: <<
	How much damage is removed from all incoming attacks by the ship's shield hardener as long as the ship's shields are active. This damage is removed before mitigation/bleedthrough is applied, but still counts towards mitigation growth. Most attacks can only be reduced to 50% of their initial damage by shield hardness, but certain weapons like Pulse Bolts can be reduced to 25%, and penetrating weapons like Piercing Drones can only be reduced to 75%.

	Damage from Shock Missiles, Disruptors, Particle Lances, Warheads, or Shield Harmonizers is not affected by shield hardness. Destroying shield hardener hexes will both reduce shield hardness and raise the minimum damage threshold until they are repaired. (For instance, reducing a shield hardener to 1% of operational hexes will reduce hardness to 1% of the stated value, and prevent it from removing more than 0.5% of most attacks' damage.)
>>
S_HARDENER_FACTOR: Mitigation Factor


STT_DEFENSEGENERATION: <<
	The amount of Defense generated by this ship. This Defense is used to construct support ships for the fleet.
>>
S_RESEARCHGENERATION: Research Generation
STT_RESEARCHGENERATION: <<
	The amount of Research generated by this ship.
>>
S_CHANNELPERCENTAGE: Channel Rate
STT_CHANNELPERCENTAGE: <<
	The rate at which resisted damage is channelled into the ship's shields.
>>

S_NILINGARMOR_DESC: <<
	Strands of quantum-reactive fibre connect the outer plating to a zero-sized sink hole in spacetime, allowing incoming energy flows to be safely redirected and stored. When enough energy has been stored, it is channeled back into normal spacetime, creating a strong EM pulse to damage surrounding enemies.

	[img=Plus]Whenever the amount of damage passing through the armor reaches the damage threshold, an area-of-effect burst is released, damaging all nearby enemies. Both the damage and the area of effect scale with the amount of damage absorbed.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Does not actually prevent damage, and has no intrinsic Health.[/img]
