S_COMBATSUPPLYREGEN: Combat Supply Regeneration
STT_COMBATSUPPLYREGEN: <<
	The rate at which this ship regenerates Supply in combat. This is in addition to normal Supply regeneration.
>>
S_BOARDTOTAL: Boarding Defense
STT_BOARDTOTAL: <<
	The strength with which the ship will fight off boarders. This number must exceed the Boarding Strength of the attacking ship's Boarding Parties in order to survive a boarding action.
>>
S_BOARDSUBSYS: Boarding Strength
STT_BOARDSUBSYS: <<
	The strength this subsystem contributes to a boarding defense. Only Boarding Parties contribute to an offensive boarding action; their offensive strength is the same as their defensive strength.

S_SENSORRANGE: Base Sensor Range
STT_SENSORRANGE: <<
	How far the ship can see, prior to the application of any multiplying effects such as entering a nebula, and prior to modification by the game's Global Sensor Multiplier.
	
	This does not necessarily have to be the actual range of the ship's sensors, but it might provide a good idea of how big that range will be.
>>
S_STRENGTH: Base Combat Strength
STT_STRENGTH: <<
	How well the ship should perform in combat. This is based both on its predicted survivability (design flaws such as exposed bridges notwithstanding) and the amount of damage it deals. (The ship's 'Base Toughness' and 'Damage / Second' statistics, respectively, represent these values.)

	This is not necessarily an accurate value - other factors such as battle damage, lack of supply, or flagship naming can alter a ship's Combat Strength - however it can still be a useful baseline.
>>
S_HULLSTRENGTH: Base Toughness
STT_HULLSTRENGTH: <<
	How well the ship should withstand hostile attacks. This is based on a variety of factors such as repair rate, shield strength and hull strength - regardless, major design flaws such as exposed control cores may cause this value to be drastically higher than it realistically should be.

	This is not necessarily an accurate value - various effects that alter the ship's maximum health can change its Toughness.
