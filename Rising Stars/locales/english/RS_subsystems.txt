S_COMBATSUPPLYREGEN: Combat Supply Regeneration
STT_COMBATSUPPLYREGEN: <<
	The rate at which this ship regenerates Supply in combat. This is in addition to normal Supply regeneration.
>>
S_BOARDTOTAL: Boarding Defense
STT_BOARDTOTAL: <<
	The strength with which the ship will fight off boarders. This number must exceed the Boarding Strength of the attacking ship's Boarding Parties in order to survive a boarding action.
>>
S_BOARDSUBSYS: Boarding Strength
STT_BOARDSUBSYS: <<
	The strength this subsystem contributes to a boarding defense. Only Boarding Parties contribute to an offensive boarding action; their offensive strength is the same as their defensive strength.
>>
S_SENSORRANGE: Base Sensor Range
STT_SENSORRANGE: <<
	How far the ship can see, prior to the application of any multiplying effects such as entering a nebula, and prior to modification by the game's Global Sensor Multiplier.
	
	This does not necessarily have to be the actual range of the ship's sensors, but it might provide a good idea of how big that range will be.
>>
S_STRENGTH: Base Combat Strength
STT_STRENGTH: <<
	How well the ship should perform in combat. This is based both on its predicted survivability (design flaws such as exposed bridges notwithstanding) and the amount of damage it deals. (The ship's 'Base Toughness' and 'Damage / Second' statistics, respectively, represent these values.)

	This is not necessarily an accurate value - other factors such as battle damage, lack of supply, or flagship naming can alter a ship's Combat Strength - however it can still be a useful baseline.
>>
S_HULLSTRENGTH: Base Toughness
STT_HULLSTRENGTH: <<
	How well the ship should withstand hostile attacks. This is based on a variety of factors such as repair rate, shield strength and hull strength - regardless, major design flaws such as exposed control cores may cause this value to be drastically higher than it realistically should be.

	This is not necessarily an accurate value - various effects that alter the ship's maximum health can change its Toughness.

	[img=Plus]Structural Reinforcement on the outside of the ship does not use up interior space.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Cheap and lightweight.[/img]
	[img=Minus][b][color=#f00]Very low[/color] [color=#80ff80]health[/color][/b].[/img]

S_CERAMICARMOR: Ceramic Armor
S_CERAMICARMOR_DESC: <<
	An armor plate constructed with layers of heat-resistant ceramic tiles that can withstand significant thermal stress. While they are simple enough to replace they are impossible to properly repair in combat or without the aid of a dockyard.

	[img=Plus]High [b][color=#c6c33a]damage resistance[/color][/b] against energy weapons.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Moderate [b][color=#c6c33a]damage resistance[/color][/b] against non-energy weapons.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Lower health than standard plating.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Cannot be repaired.[/img]
	[img=Minus]When a Ceramic Armor hex is destroyed, it is permanently removed from the ship.[/img]

S_FERROFLUIDARMOR: Ferrofluid Armor
S_FERROFLUIDARMOR_DESC: <<
	A basin of liquid ferro-metal precisely controlled and suspended on the hull of the ship by an electromagnetic field. The ferro-metal absorbs impacts and spreads them evenly, filling any gaps that are created. The advanced electromagnetic field is configured to strongly repel traditional projectiles, and can draw back the ferro-metal to form firing ports when needed without exposing gun turrets to retaliatory fire.

	[img=Plus]High [b][color=#80ff80]health[/color][/b].[/img]
	[img=Plus]Health flows from high health hexes to connected low health hexes to equalize density.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Armor on the outside of the ship does not use up interior space.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Does not block weapon arcs or engine exhausts.[/img]
	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Does not provide any damage resistance against Energy or Explosive damage.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Heavier, more expensive and more labor-intensive than standard Liquid Armor, and cannot interact with it.[/img]
>>
NANOMESH_NAME: Nanomesh
NANOMESH_DESC: <<
	A finely weaved mesh of nanobots strengthen the integrity of nearby subsystems.
	
	[img=Plus]Increases the [b][color=#80ff80]health[/color][/b] of surrounding hexes.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Health bonus is improved by armor health research.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Always uses internal space.[/img]
	[img=Minus]The nanomesh itself has no health.[/img]
>>
S_SELF_DESTRUCT_DESC: <<
	A massive warhead designed to detonate when the host vessel becomes unstable.

	[img=Plus]Deals extreme damage in a large area when the ship is destroyed.[/img]
	[img=Minus]You die.[/img]
>>
S_SELF_DESTRUCT: Self-Destruct Device
