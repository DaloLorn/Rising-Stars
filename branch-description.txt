WARNING: This description format can only be read by an outdated version of SR2MM. It has been deprecated in v1.1.1, and is no longer guaranteed to provide accurate information about the selected branch.

It is recommended that you update to the latest version of the OpenSR Launchpad at your earliest convenience.
**********************************************

The purpose of this branch is unclear due to an issue that was fixed by the new branch description format.

Since 1.3.0, Rising Stars requires the SR2 Community Patch to be installed, from the branch "master". SR2MM versions 1.1.0 and above (and the OpenSR Launchpad) will automatically install the Community Patch when you try to install Rising Stars from this branch.

Since 1.3.1, Rising Stars instead requires the OpenSR Modpack. As above, this is automatically handled by new enough versions of SR2MM, or the OpenSR Launchpad.
